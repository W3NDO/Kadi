# KADI

This is the Kenyan version of Poker. Rulesets are varied from region to region, so I am working with this specific rule set.

## Ruleset
### Cards
There are 3 types of cards. 
#### 1. Feeding Cards
**2** , **3** and **Joker** are considered feeding cards. When played, the next player has to pick 2, 3 or 5 cards respectively, or add a compatible feeding card. A compatible feeding card would have the same face/number, i.e if a 2 of Hearts is played a compatible feeding card would be a 2 of Clubs/Spades/Diamonds, a 3 of hearts or a Joker.

#### 2. Winning Cards
**4 to 10**

These are cards that can be played to win the game. Of note is that **8** and **Q** are question cards that have to be played with an answer. An answer is a compatible face from 4-10. This means you can drop an 8 of hearts with a 4 of hearts. You can also stack question cards together as long as the last card stacked has a compatible answer played after it. 

#### 3. Special Cards
**A, K, J, and Q**

**A** can be used to demand a change in the face being played. For instance, if the game was Hearts, you can play **A** to request the face be changed to a Diamond.

**J** skips the next player's turn

**K** is a kickback meaning the game continues in the opposite direction. 

You can not win the game if you have any of the Special Cards. 

## How to Play & Win
There is a starter_card placed on the table. The first player must match the face/number or pick a card.

The game ends if a player legally plays all the cards they have left in one move.
